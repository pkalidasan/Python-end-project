Project Title: Analysis of Employee Data at ABC Company

In this project, we analysis a dataset from ABC Company, comprising 458 rows and 9 columns, to gain insights into the employees' demographics, positions, and salary distribution across various teams. The project involves preprocessing the dataset to ensure data consistency and integrity, followed by performing comprehensive analysis tasks and presenting the findings graphically.
 Preprocessing:
We started by correcting the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180, ensuring that the data remains consistent and reliable for further analysis.
Analysis Tasks:

 1. Distribution of Employees across Each Team:
We determined the distribution of employees across each team and calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. This analysis provides insights into the workforce distribution within the organization.

 2. Segregation of Employees Based on Positions:
Employees were segregated based on their positions within the company, allowing us to understand the composition of roles and responsibilities across the workforce.

3. Predominant Age Group among Employees:
Identifying the predominant age group among employees enables us to understand the age demographics of the workforce and potentially uncover any age-related trends.

 4. Team and Position with the Highest Salary Expenditure:
We discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure, shedding light on the financial allocation within the organization.

 5. Correlation between Age and Salary:
Investigating the correlation between age and salary allows us to explore potential relationships between these variables and understand how age influences salary within the company.

 Graphical Representation:
For each analysis task, we created appropriate visualizations to present our findings effectively. These visualizations include bar plots, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots, enabling clear and concise communication of insights derived from the data.
 Conclusion:
Through the preprocessing, analysis, and graphical representation, we gained valuable insights into the employee data at ABC Company. These insights can inform decision-making processes related to workforce management, resource allocation, and talent development strategies within the organization.
